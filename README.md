# Labyrinther - solving mazes with GA in Python

# What and why?

This is a project developed for an undergraduate course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" in Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The task given to us was to make a program that would solve mazes using a genetic algorithm, representing the path itself as a sequence of bits (2 bits is enough to encode top/bottom/left/right)
